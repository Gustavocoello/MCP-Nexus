# 🧠 What is the MCP-Nexus Project?

> 🇪🇸 ¿Prefieres leer en español? [Click aquí para la versión en español](./README.es.md)

The project aims to **help developers become more productive** through an intelligent conversational interface. It also enables anyone to access a **ChatGPT-like generative AI for free and unlimited**, running entirely **locally**.

> **Important:** We're not building a language model (LLM) ourselves. We use OpenRouter as a gateway to access existing models for free.

We use modern technologies like:

- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol)
- **Azure AI Vision**
- **SQL databases**
- **File readers (PDF, Markdown, etc.)**
- **Smart flows with memory**, using automatic summarization

## 🤖 What’s the name of this generative AI?

We named it **JARVIS**, inspired by Iron Man’s intelligent assistant.

---

## ✅ JARVIS Features

### 💬 Messages
- Real-time streaming responses
- Memory-supported chats (summary + recent messages)

### 🖼️ Images
- Image preview in the conversation
- Embedded images in model responses
- Auto-scroll with new messages or images

### 📎 Files
- Upload support for images, PDF, Markdown, and more
- Files are processed and added to model context

### 📅 MCP Integration (Model Context Protocol)
- Currently integrated with **Google Calendar**
- Plans to expand to Notion, Slack, Gmail, and more


---

## 🧠 Contextual Memory Plan

Proposed architecture to maintain effective memory:

- All messages are stored in the database
- If history grows, everything is summarized except the 10 most recent messages
- Always sent as context: `summary + last messages + current input`


---

## 🗃️ Database Structure

- `Chat` model: stores accumulated summaries
- `Message` model: stores each message with role (user / assistant)
- Model `users`: contains the users
- Model `UserToken`: stores the tokens for login with Google and the MCP- Model
- `UserMemory`: serves for the memory of the LLM

---

## 👥 MCP Multiuser Support

The system uses OAuth 2.0 with per-user tokens. Each user:

- Connects their personal Google account
- Tokens are securely encrypted
- Calendar events are queried securely and privately

---

## 🧩 Technical Infrastructure

- **Frontend**: React + CSS + MarkdownIt
- **Backend**: Flask (Auth) + FastAPI (MCP/OpenRouter)
- **Database**: MYSQL (local) → Azure Database
- **OAuth**: Google with per-user token
- **LLM**: OpenRouter (DeepSeek, Qwen3, etc.) with streaming
- **Containers**: Docker + Render
